Embellishments to code in JS & JQ book by Jon Duckett.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
The embellishments are for the purpose of enhancing the learning of how the JS changes the original html. The original code is in http://javascriptbook.com/code/ In the book, this code filenames are referenced a code snippet is printed: for example, In "Chapter 5: Document Object Model", the first code is HTML in file c05/get-element.by-id.html. In the code (not in the snippet) it includes at the bottom of the body. 
This JS immediately changes the DOM and thus what the browser displays. The embellishment in the code files changeClassOfId.html and changeClassOfId.js, I load the JS changes with buttons. This way, the file loads in its original state and the change originally made by get-element-by-id.js only occur when a button is clicked. Further, another button changes it back to the original. The original postings here include enhancements to js/get-element-by-id files and get-elements-by-class-name files, to changeClassOfId and changeClassOfClasses, respectively. The all css and images files are available at http://javascriptbook.com/code/ by choosing the big green Download to get the file javascript-and-jquery-book-code-0915.zip. Chapter 5 css and images are in the c05 folder along with the html and js files. Hope this helps the learners and perhaps you can enhance other code and post it here, can't you?

A note for the absolute beginner - updated to use the new JS&JQbook folder:
  1. Make (or use) a directory of your choice on your computer, say JS&JQ, a 'home' folder.
  2. Download the zip file - "Download ZIP" is on the right side of screen just above the files list.
  3. Unpack the zip file into that 'home' directory: 
          It includes sub-folders for js, css, and images files.
  5. Open an html file in a browser (just double-click on the file) and voila! You have a demo app (for each html file).
  I added this because I remember being frustrated when I was beginning that people assumed we knew all of this, and I did not, yet.
